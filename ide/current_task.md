- [x] Implement API endpoints for question processing
- [x] Add visualization data generation for vector search

### Frontend Development
- [x] Design chatbot interface
- [x] Create visualization components
- [x] Implement responsive design with Tailwind
- [x] Add animations for better UX

### Integration & Testing
- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Test question processing flow

- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on different devices

## Current Status
We have successfully created a web application with:
1. A Flask backend that integrates with wisdom_qa.py functionality
2. A clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
3. A chatbot interface with animations and typing indicators
4. Real-time visualizations of vector search results and similarity scores
5. Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views

The application now needs testing with actual questions to ensure the question processing flow works correctly and to verify responsiveness across different devices
