# PDF Extractor Project Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a PDF extraction and analysis service built with a microservices architecture. It provides functionality for extracting content from PDFs, performing semantic search, and answering questions based on the content. The system uses vector embeddings for semantic search and integrates with various LLM providers for natural language processing.

## Architecture
The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests, routing to appropriate services
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization with JWT and API keys
- **PDF Processing Service**: Extracts and processes PDF content, chunking text for vector storage
- **Vector Search Service**: Performs semantic search using vector embeddings with Annoy
- **LLM Service**: Integrates with multiple language model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc.)
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks usage and provides analytics with Redis-based storage
- **Database Service**: Manages data persistence with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Task Queue**: Handles asynchronous processing with Celery and Redis

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Flask with Gunicorn for production
- **Database**: MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Vector Storage**: Annoy (replacing Pinecone)
- **Message Broker/Cache**: Redis
- **Task Queue**: Celery
- **Authentication**: JWT and API Keys with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI, MkDocs
- **Testing**: pytest with mocking and coverage
- **Embedding Models**: Sentence Transformers
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, DeepSeek, OpenRouter
